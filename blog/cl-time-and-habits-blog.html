        <h3>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3><br><br>
        <p>Since I have started with the sprints, I have found that time is running away from me and I can spend hours doing something without taking a break (provided my little one sleeps!)  I think having a structured system that forces me to take breaks like the pomodoro technique will be good for me.  I have found toggl helpful for this, because I look at the timer thinking it’s only been ten mins to find it’s been forty. <br><br>
        At my previous work, we were analysed into different profiles by talent dynamics to ascertain what activities we need to do to be in flow.  I came out as a mechanic which basically means that I’m detail oriented but also creative and innovative.  To be in my flow and work at my best, I need to be improving systems and problem solving.  Although parts of this system of profiling people didn’t appeal to me because I felt it was too simplistic to put everyone in a box, I did find it interesting to see that a lot of what was defined in my ‘profile’ rang true to me and my work mates found this true as well.  I found the articles on flow interesting because sometimes we want to be focused on something but no matter how hard you try you can’t seem to get into the groove with it.  Being focused on the kinds of things that make you happy in your work is important.<br><p>
        
        <h3>what did you find interesting? </h3><br><br>
        <p>I found the idea of weakening the connections between the me centre and bodily sensations through meditation really interesting.  The idea that you can lessen anxiety in this way makes me a little sceptical but it would be worth trying just to see if it was possible.  I also thought it would be worth trying in order to increase my memory – important when trying to process so much new information.  The idea that the ability to block out distractions assists memory makes sense.  The more you focus on something completely, the better you learn it and understand it.  I say this as I type reflections with my baby on my lap!<br><br>
        Interestingly, growth mindset is something that they focus on at my children’s school so it was great to see that article.  The idea that you only have an inherent amount of ability in something and that is it doesn’t encourage people to seek self improvement as it breeds the attitude of, “Well I’ll never be better at that”.  Not such a fabulous attitude to have when trying to learn something new. <br><p>
        <h3>what worked for you? </h3><br><br>
        <p>I liked the idea of meditation not just being sitting in a class listening to meditation music with a teacher, but things like moving meditation.  I find crocheting very relaxing and it’s definitely easier for me to relax and focus when I have something to do with my hands. <br><br>
        For me, every time that I feel like I have achieved something with coding, it increases my thinking that maybe I can do this and that small steps are big achievements.  I definitely don’t have a lot of confidence for coding so small wins are big for me.<br><br>
        I think the counterintuitive tips appealed to me because at the moment, I find all the new information for coding insanely interesting so it’s easier to focus on.  But I know that when I have had assignments in previous study, I left everything to the last minute because an approaching deadline was the biggest motivator.  I found that if I spent too long on something, not only did I find myself dragging my feet, but I inevitably wound up with a lower grade at the end of it.  So leaving myself less time to do something (and mess around more) made more sense to me. <br><p>
        
        <h3>which will you experiment further with? </h3><br><br>
        <p>I’m definitely going to give the Pomodoro technique a try in the future.  I think I’m in danger of trying to go to big with lots of things.  I tend to dive in and want to be able to complete everything all at once.  It’ll be good to remind myself to slow down and take things in small chunks.  I think working with our own personal rhythms is important and knowing what you need in order to get into your flow.  I think I’ll be using toggl to look at when I am doing the most work, when I am getting a lot done and trying to use that to inform what I do from here on out. <br><p>
