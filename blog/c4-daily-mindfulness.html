              <h3>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h3><hr>
                <p>
                  I learnt how hard it actually is to sit and listen for three minutes
                  without responding other than acknowledging.  We are so used to responding
                  to what someone is saying that we often don't allow the other person the full time
                  to organise their thoughts and express themselves.<br><br>
                  I guess it's like the concept that most people don't listen with the intent to really
                  listen, they are just waiting for their chance to speak.  When you know that you
                  are not going to respond in any way, it can be difficult, but it forces you to actually
                  listen to the other person instead of just waiting for a chance to interrupt or take over.

                  <h3> Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h3>
                  <p>
                    I'm definitely going to attempt to listen more mindfully in my life.
                    I think it's a sign of respect and care for the person to really listen attentively.
                    Looping I think is also very important because it leaves no room for
                    misinterpretation and misunderstanding.  I can think of some previous work
                    situations that could have been avoided if the people involved looped back their
                    understanding of a conversation back to one another.
