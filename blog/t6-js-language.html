              <h3>In the JavaScript language, describe all the use cases for each of:</h3><hr>
                <p>
                    <strong>Parentheses ()</strong> - Parentheses are used to indicate the argument for a function.  So if you assign a function 
                    to a block of code that you want to use again, the bit in the parentheses indicates the variable you are using 
                    within the function.  You also use them around a string ie:<br> console.log('Hello World!'); <br>Also used to group 
                    statements in a loop or if/else statements ie <br>if: (condition 1) {<br> statement 1 }<br> or for (var i=0; i > 0; i -=2)<br>
                    There's probably other uses that I have missed.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Brackets []</strong> - These brackets are used to indicate an array.  You can use them to access an item in an array
                    by its number ie myArray[0], they are used to indicate when there are multiple properties assigned to an object ie:<br>
                    var cat = { <br>"enemies": ["water", "dogs"]};
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Braces {}</strong> - Curly braces are used to indicate a block of code, so you find them everywhere.  Anything contained 
                    within them is code that's executed together.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Single quotes '' or double quotes "" </strong>- Can be used to indicate a string name.  Are basically interchangeable 
                    providing that you keep to whichever version you have chosen at the beginning and end.  <br><br>Can be very frustrating 
                    problem solving code that turns out you put the wrong quote somewhere... or wrong amount of curly braces.... or 
                    put a capital letter somewhere there shouldn't be... sigh.<br><br>
