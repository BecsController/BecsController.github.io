            <h3>The CSS Zen Garden</h3><hr><br>
              <p>
                <strong>Wow</strong>, so looking through the <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a>
                was eyeopening.  I was blown away with some of the sites, especially the ones with java
                elements.  I cannot wait to get into that.<br><br> I spent ages on Steffen Knoeller's
                site <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/219/">Steel</a>, going further and further
                down into all his elements to see how everything was structured.  In terms of design,
                I think that the overall look was relatively simple, being monochromatic, which was
                great.  However, the moveable elements were amazing and I just wanted to dig in and
                find out how it all works.<br><br>I found that some of the sites were too much for me
                in terms of colour.  It really reinforces how important colour and font choices etc are
                 to user experience.  I'm very glad that hubby is a graphic designer and I am able to
                 get his imput into how my choices look, because having a second eye is always a good
                 idea, especially one whose job it is to make aesthetically pleasing choices!

                <h3>My Wish List</h3><br>
                <ul>
                  <li>JAVA:<br>Although I know that I'm probably going to be left scratching my head a lot, I can't wait to add moving parts to my webpage.</li><br>
                  <li>Interesting font choices:<br>I liked designs that had font running horizontally up their elements or had a point of difference in the way they were laid out. </li><br>
                  <li>Icons:<br>Some of the more interesting pages I saw had icons with their headings etc to link content together.</li>

                  <h3>My Analogy</h3><br>
                  <p>
                    I have spent a great deal of time trying to explain what I'm learning to my Dad
                    recently lol, so here goes with what I told him.<br><br>If you think of a webpage
                    as being like a body, html is the bones.  It gives the structure to the body and
                    it is what everything else is built upon.  CSS is how your body looks; the muscles
                    and skin etc that are built on top of your bones.<br><br>The <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>
                    is the way we section off the body into parts, i.e. the torso, the head, legs, arms etc.
                    If we drew the body and drew lines separating these parts from eachother into squares,
                    it would make it easier to decide what the different parts need to look the way we want
                    them to look.  Using squares to separate out our web page in this way is what is known
                    as <em>boxifying design.</em>

                  <h3>What is the box model?</h3><br>
                  <p>
                    The box model is a system to modify the way the content looks within its box on the
                    page.  This is achieved using margins, padding and borders.  These parts are nested
                    within one another like a russian doll with the content in the centre, surrounded
                    by padding, which is space between the content and the next part, it's border.
                    <br><br>  This border which can be displayed in a multitude of different ways is
                    then surrounded by space called the margin.  These terms are all pretty familiar
                    to anyone who has spent any amount of time making documents on Microsoft Word or
                    a similar program.<br><br>
