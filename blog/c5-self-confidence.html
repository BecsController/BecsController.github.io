              <h3>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3><hr>
                <p>
                  In part, mindfulness is focus and control.  Self awareness allows you to
                  have focus and control because you know yourself.  You know why you are doing
                  something, or feeling something, and if you know that, you are better able to
                  control what you are doing or how you are feeling - or at least respond in better
                  ways to it.  I liked the metaphor that, 'The moment you can see a raging river, it
                  means you are already rising above it.'  Knowledge is power and that's true about your
                  control over yourself as well. <br><br>
                  Minfulness provides you with the stabilty, clarity and focus to really look at yourself
                  and see yourself objectively and with honesty to evaluate your strenghts, weaknesses and
                  really understand why you react the way you do to certain things.

                  <h3> Body Scan - What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h3>
                  <p>
                    I have been asked to do a similar process to focus on different parts of the body in order to relax
                    and/or fall asleep before and I do find it can be very calming and relaxing.  I do however
                    find it difficult to shut off my mind, so I have to try really hard to focus on
                    bringing it back when it wanders.  Bringing a joyful memory to mind has an
                    awesome effect on the body, it's surprising how much it changes your whole feeling
                    about the moment when you remember something that brings you total happiness.

                    <h3>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h3>
                    <p>
                      I really liked the metaphor about the sky and the clouds.  When trying to teach
                      my children about positive ways to manage their emotions, I have spent a lot of
                      time trying to analyse how different people react to and deal with their emotions
                      and why.  This section was really apt for me and something I will be sharing with
                      my son because, especially when we get angry, we tend to think of emotions as defining
                      us, particularly if we feel like we cannot control them.  Beginning to look at them
                      as something that pass, as simply a physiological experience that can be dealt with
                      is a great step towards better emotional management.
