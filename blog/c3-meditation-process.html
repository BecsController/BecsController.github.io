              <h3>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3><hr>
                <p>
                  I had to give up my ideals of what I want to achieve with this web page....for now.
                  I know that I'm not able to do everything that I want and from what I have seen and
                  learnt so far, everything in coding is a learning process that you are never finished
                  with, so focusing on the learning journey is a much better way to have satisfaction with
                  how you are doing.

                  <h3>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h3>
                  <p>
                    I have to admit that I didn't really think of meditation in terms of active
                    meditation before.  I only thought of it in terms of structured environments where
                    people are listening to new age music and trying to achieve some level of spiritual
                    clarity.  It's nice to read about it in terms of a more scientific process and one
                    that's focused on bettering yourself physically and behaviourally.

                    <p>
                      I guess what I have mentioned above about the nature of meditation.
                      Also the different ways you can use it in a simple way to centre yourself
                      and increase your focus, which is beneficial for study and work.

                    <h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
                      <p>
                        I did like the idea of active meditation and just taking a minute or so a day
                        to try and quieten your mind.  To see it like using a muscle and even when your
                        mind wanders, that the process of bringing it back to silence and calm is increasing
                        your level of focus.<br><br><a class="button blog" href="/blog/c3-meditation-process.html">Back to top</a>
