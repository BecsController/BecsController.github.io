              <h3>What is Scope and how does it work in Javascript?</h3><hr>
                <p>
                  There are two types of scope in JavaScript - local and global.  Local scope means
                  that the object is only available and readable within its function.  Global scope
                  means that it is available throughout the whole programme.<br><br>
                  It's like if you were building a car and you wanted to apply certain
                  characteristics to it, like number of wheels.  If you defined a local variable,
                  it would be like your own personal car that had five wheels. But a global scope
                  would mean you could make car after car with three wheels but they wouldn't be
                  personal to you they would be the same car over and over.
