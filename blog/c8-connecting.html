              <h3>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h3><hr>
                <p>
                  No, I don't think that I have tried any of the techniques mentioned before but I think that 
                  a lot of them are really good suggestions - particulary the three assumptions for working in a group.
                  When you start from a basis of assuming everyone is trying to do the right thing, it would allow you to be 
                  more empathetic and understanding of differences in opinion and communication style.<br><br>
                  I liked the idea about training yourself to build empathy for others.  I do find that I have a complete 
                  lack of empathy for people that I feel have wronged me badly and it does affect my ability to move past 
                  these past hurts or transgressions.  I think directing positive thoughts towards those people who have hurt 
                  me would allow me to build up empathy and therefore allow myself to heal from those hurts better.

                <h3>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h3><hr>
                    <p>
                      Empathetic listening is great, I always find it helps in conflict resolution to express 
                      verbally how you 'think' the other person is feeling.  It makes communication so much more effective
                      and exposes your inherent bias when the other person can turn around and say, yes, I do feel that way or no 
                      you've got that completely wrong.  The way that you react depends so much on your own interpretation of 
                      a situation so actually saying out loud how you interpret something can only strengthen understandings between 
                      two parties.

                <h3> How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h3><hr>
                    <p>
                        I think it's a positive thing to actively focus on feeling positive 
                        emotion rather than negative ones, no matter who it is directed at, yourself or others.

                  <h3> Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h3>
                  <p>
                    My story is that I was working for a company and our supervisor took some time out 
                    to go overseas to visit her family.  During the two weeks that she was supposed to 
                    be away, I found that she had left her personal facebook logged in to the work computer, so 
                    when we were using the computer, there were private message windows popping up on the desktop that were talking about 
                    how in actual fact, she had moved back overseas and taken another job over there.
                    We were also getting phone calls from debt collectors who were trying to reach her as she had 
                    defaulted on loan payments.  Because I knew that she also owed money to the owner of the company 
                    for a course she had completed, I let my bosses know what was coming up on the computer so 
                    that they could get in contact with her and find out what was happening.
                    <br><br>
                    From my perspective, I felt very torn between loyalties but I felt like what she had done was 
                    wrong and the owner of the business had the right to talk to her and find out what was happening.
                    <br>From her perspective, she was in a desperate situation and had to do what was the best for herself and 
                    her family.<br><br>
                    I found this exercise a bit difficult, because I can empathise with my supervisors situation very 
                    easily, however, I do not agree that she did the right thing and so it was difficult to look for a 
                    perspective on the situation where she was 100% right.  It is a great task to practice empathy though.
