            <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3><br>
              <p>I loved the scientific explanations of things that can be seen
                as new age thinking and therefore sometimes less credible. As Meng said, "It’s not just
                woo-woo talk by some New Age person; it is something so tangible,
                you can see it and actually measure it with a ruler."
                I liked the idea that the default state for the mind is happiness.
                That happiness is not something that you pursue; it is something
                you allow.<br><br>
                The biggest thing I think I took away from the chapter was how much
                your thinking can influence your environment, your behaviour and
                your abilities. The idea of just accepting how things are in the
                moment and being open to it as really important and that Whatever
                it is that you are experiencing, just experience it.
                Do not judge it to be good or bad. Let it be.  This is something
                to hold to when delving in to a new environment like we all are
                at the moment.<br><br> I liked the focus on self improvement
                and self awareness.  The idea of “neuroplasticity.” and that what
                we think, do, and pay attention to changes the structure and function of
                our brains.  For me, I found it made a lot of sense to use mindfulness
                and meditation to improve our ability to regulate our attention
                as a tool to significantly impact how we respond to our emotions and experiences.<br>
                <br>Reading forward in Meng's book, I thought that looping in conversation
                would be a great practice in workplaces to avoid misunderstandings.
                Overall, what I have read so far I have found beneficial
                I plan to finish the book to see what else I can take away from it.

            <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness? </h3> <br>
              <p> I found it a bit difficult to stop my mind from wandering when
                trying to practice mindfulness.  If I try to focus on nothing for
                too long, my mind starts making lists of all the things I have
                to do which isn't that helpful.  It will be something that I will
                have to actively practice. <br><br></p>
