            <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3><br>
              <p>I loved the scientific explanations of things that can be seen
                as new age thinking and therefore less credible. it’s not just
                woo-woo talk by some New Age person; it is something so tangible,
                you can see it and actually measure it with a ruler.  In particular,
                the explanations of gut thinking and intuition.
                I liked the idea that the default state for the mind is happiness.
                That happiness is not something that you pursue; it is something
                you allow.
                Whatever it is that you are experiencing, just experience it.
                Do not judge it to be good or bad. Let it be,
                "The ability to monitor one’s own and others’ feelings and
                emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information
                to guide one’s thinking and actions."
                Self-awareness,Self-regulation,Motivation,Empathy,Social skills.
                happiness may be an unavoidable side effect of cultivating emotional
                intelligence. Other side effects may include resilience, optimism,
                and kindness.  “neuroplasticity.” The idea is that what we think,
                do, and pay attention to changes the structure and function of
                our brains.  self-awareness depends on being able to see
                ourselves objectively, and that requires the ability to examine
                our thoughts and emotions from a third-person perspective.
                There is scientific evidence showing that improving our ability
                to regulate our attention can significantly impact how we respond
                to emotions.
                I think that looping in conversation would be a great practice
                in workplaces to avoid misunderstandings between peers and between
                leaders and their employees.
                Emotional awareness, accurate self-assessment and self confidence.
                I let my ego be simultaneously big and small, and I quietly laugh
                at its absurdity. That is a shy engineer’s secret to self-confidence.

            <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness? </h3> <br>
              <p> I found it a bit difficult to stop my mind from wandering when
                trying to practice mindfulness.  If I try to focus on nothing for
                too long, my mind starts making lists of all the things I have
                to do which isn't that helpful.  It will be something that I will
                have to actively practice. <br><br></p>
