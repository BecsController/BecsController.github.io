              <h3>That time I got blocked....</h3><hr>
                <p>
                  So I was trying to create a chess board this sprint in JavaScript.  It basically
                  asked me to write code to generate a line of eight characters, with either
                  a blank space or a black space shown by a '#'.  When I had mastered that,
                  I had to get it to create alternating lines, one starting with blank, the next
                  line starting with '#' until I had eight lines in total.<br><br>
                  Sounds simple huh?  No.  I was stuck on this for a little while.  I tried
                  creating a white line and a black line but then asking it to repeat itself
                  became a challenge.  I then had to find a way to put the lines together
                  so that they were under one formula that simply asked whether the number of
                  the square was even or odd and assigned a black square or a '#' based on that.
                  I thought I had that figured that out but when I ran the code, the entire
                  'board' came out the same on every line.<br><br>
                  In order to solve my problem, I drew a 'chess board', which simply consisted of
                  numbering each square from 1 - 64.  I realised that every new line would start
                  with an odd number so if my loop for black and my loop for white both started at
                  zero, they would return the exact same line.  I changed one of my lines to start
                  at one instead of a zero and bam! It came out the way intended :)<br><br>
                  I felt quite frustrated at the time, I spent ages just staring at the code and then
                  had to tell myself, 'Nope, looking at this the same way over and over isn't going to
                  produce a different result.'  When I decided to try something completely different
                  (and off the screen) to look at the problem, I saw what the problem was.  I learnt
                  that for me, taking pen to paper and drawing out my problem was a great way for
                  me to think differently about what exactly it was that I needed.  I definitely
                  should try more psuedocoding!!!!

                  <h3>Techniques I feel most comfortable using</h3>
                  <p>
                    I am pretty confident googling my problems.  I am pretty good at typing
                    the right combination of words into google to get it to spit out some suggestions
                    for me and I don't mind trawling through page after page to find helpful hints.
                    I have to admit that I haven't tried the rubber ducky method yet, however, my partner
                    has found me next to my computer muttering to myself and talking through what I
                    understand out loud so I guess that's a similar thing.  Maybe I just need to direct
                    my nonsense <strong>to</strong> someone!<br><br>
                    Throughout this sprint I have been getting better at console.logging because
                    I have had certain activities where I have tried to build up what I am supposed to be
                    doing bit by bit and just seeing what gets printed out before trying something else.
                    My biggest problem sometimes is being overwhelmed by what I'm being asked to do and
                    spending a long time trying to think of where to start, when if I broke things down into
                    manageable chunks I would get there a lot better.  I do have to get better at just trying
                    something and having a go without worrying about whether it's all going to come
                    out wrong because that's what we are here for after all. <br><br>
