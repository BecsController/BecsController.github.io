            <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3><br>
              <p> I’m loving phase 0 so far.  I love that I get access to all these
                resources (In addition to ones I’ve found on my own) and I can just
                keep going over material and playing with things myself until I
                understand.  So far, everything feels really open and it seems like
                everyone from Dev Academy genuinely wants to help and support each
                other which is great.<br>
              </p>
            <h3>What are your impressions? </h3> <br>
              <p> I liked hearing the kitchen vs restaurant analogy.  It aligns with a lot of what I
                  have been geared towards in my teacher education.  The concept of
                  inspiring people to learn and not seeing themselves as passive in
                  the learning experience is definitely something that I believe in.<br>
                  <br>It was reassuring to know that although we may feel like we’re
                  not all going to be in the same boat and some people may know more
                  than others, there won’t be that much difference between us and we
                  all have our strengths and weaknesses.  At the moment, I feel like
                  I’m just playing around, working things out in my own way and having
                  a blast doing it.  I know that a lot of the ways that I am doing
                  things won’t be correct or the best/most time effective way to go
                  about it but I feel like I’m learning so much already and that
                  working things out in a way that makes sense to me is more important
                  than getting things right first time.<br><br>
              </p>
            <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3><br>
              <p> I can be a shy person, so I feel like the part that
                  I will struggle with most is putting myself out there in terms
                  of socially engaging with everyone.<br>
              </p>
            <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3> <br>
              <p> I came in to this expecting to find it intense and
                  challenging and exciting, so as of now, it’s living up to my
                  expectations.<br>
              </p>
            <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous? </h3> <br>
              <p> It definitely makes me nervous.  It’s a big move for me to change
                  my career and try something completely different, not to
                  mention the bootcamp being a completely different learning
                  environment than I have experienced so far, but I am really
                  excited.  Every time I learn something new it opens up a whole
                  new set of challenges and problems so I feel like I could just
                  keep going and going. <br>
