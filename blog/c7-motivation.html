              <h3>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h3><hr>
                <p>
                  Pleasure is the temporary type of happiness, the kind that you get from short term
                  highs, it makes you feel really good really quickly but by its nature, isn't built
                  to last.  Passion is where you find your niche, where you are working with your
                  personality and nature, in your flow.  Doing something for the sake of doing it
                  because it is enjoyable to you.  It is challenging enough to keep you engaged, but
                  easy enough to make you feel good about yourself. This is more sustainable than pleasure.
                  <br><br>Higher purpose, is something that means a lot to you and is about more than just
                  yourself.  It's the most sustainable type of happiness.  If we work towards
                  something that serves our higher purpose, then we are happy and do well at our
                  work and it becomes a source of sustainable happiness.  It also means that your
                  happiness is not reliant on external things.

                  <h3>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, What are your core values? What do you stand for?</h3><hr>
                    <p>
                      My core values are honesty, respect and effort.  I feel as though they can be applied to almost
                      every situation.  If you are honest with yourself and others, you are acting with integrity
                      and trying to be the best person you can be.  Respect leads you to act with kindness and to
                      place everyone on equal standing - equally deserving of kind and considerate treatment.  To me,
                      effort means acknowledging that there is always something to learn, always a way you can improve and
                      to do that you need to try.  You need to put in effort and really focus on what you are doing in
                      order to improve and grow as a person.<br><br>What I stand for is the fact that everyone deserves
                      to be happy and to have a good quality of life.  I stand for the fact that we should take care of
                      one another and that means speaking up for others, standing against injustice and mistreatment.

                  <h3>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Because you often feel strong physical reactions to both types of memory,
                    that of failure and that of success, it can be difficult to experience them
                    simply as physiological sensations.  I experienced strong physical reactions
                    to both memories and I'm still learning how to detach myself more from them
                    so that they don't affect me as much and I can maintain calmness throughout.
                    Practice, practice!
