              <h3>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h3><hr>
                <p>
                  Javascript I find a lot more technical.  It works through functions and statements
                  that have more in common with mathmatical equations than HTML or CSS.
                </p><br>
                </section>

                <section>
                  <h3> Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h3>
                  <p>
                    A loop is a sequence that you perform in order that is established
                    by a set of parameters.  It repeats until a certain set condition is met.
                    So, for example, if your clothes are dirty, then place them in the washing
                    machine.  If the clothes are in the washing machine then turn it on.
                    If the clothes are in the machine clean, hang them out to dry etc.  If any of
                    the statements aren't true, ie if your clothes aren't dirty, then there's no need
                    to put them in the washing machine and therefore that command won't be executed.<br><br>
                    Control flow is the order in which statements are run.  These are normally from
                    the first til the last line.  However, a loop breaks this pattern as it can be repeated
                    as many times as necessary to reach it's set conditions.
                  </p><br>

                <section>
                  <h3> Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
                    <p>
                      An array allows you to keep more than one piece of data in a single variable.  They are
                      assigned a numerical value starting at zero which can be used to recall them.
                      Objects can hold multiple values as well, but their data is defined in pairs of a property
                      name with a corresponding value and you access their data by their property name.
                    </p><br>
                </section>

                <section>
                  <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
                    <p>
                      A function is a block of code, sort of like the body tag in HTML in that it contains
                      other lines of code within it.  A function defines what you want to happen.  The
                      benefit of it is that once you set its variables and arguments.  You can call the function
                      again and again without having to write out the whole lot of code.
