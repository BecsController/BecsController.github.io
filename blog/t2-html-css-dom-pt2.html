              <p>
                Using boxes broken up into rows and columns to define content
                working from left to right, top to bottom to section out a
                webpage so that you can easily define the layout.

            <h3>Whatâ€™s all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
              <p>
                Because devices have evolved so much, users are no longer just
                using their computers to access the internet.  Phones and
                tablets are very common ways to use the internet and they have
                different screen sizes to traditional screens (which have
                themselves developed to have many more options than they
                originally had).<br><br> In order to have your web pages be
                responsive, they have to be able to adapt to different screen
                sizes and resolutions and still display in the original way
                intended.

          <section>
              <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
                <p>
                  Breaking up the web page into tags, classes and ids
                  in order to define different sections easily and
                  give different rules to the various elements.  This
                  makes your code easy to edit and understand.<br><br>
