              <h3>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h3><hr>
                <p>
                  Running in to a problem when I completely don't think there should be one there causes a disproportionate emotional
                  response for me.  If I truly thought I had something right and I try it and it turns out that i've done something wrong
                  it's difficult because I don't necessarily have an idea of where to start to correct the issue.

                  <h3>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h3><hr>
                  <p>
                    I found the process quite helpful to actually identify where I feel negative emotion in my body.  As the event
                    that I had chosen to refelct on brought a strong emotional reaction, even considering it in the past tense,
                    I was easily able to notice that anger tightens itself in my chest and that the hairs on my arms stood up just from
                    thinking about it.<br>
                    Just the act of concentrating enough on myself to notice where the anger was presenting in my body was enough
                    to break some of the emotional response I was having.  It was as if it allowed me to detach a bit more and
                    see the event non-judgementally, as something that happened but didn't necessarily need to still affect me.
                    I guess the difference between pain and aversion as the book talks about.  It was an interesting process.
